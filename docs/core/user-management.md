# User Management & Role Framework

## Purpose

The User Management Framework controls authentication, authorization, access permissions and user ownership across all ERP modules.

The framework must support multiple companies, multiple branches, multiple roles and unlimited users.

Every user must be assigned appropriate access rights based on their responsibilities within the organization.

This framework serves as the security foundation for the entire ERP platform.
